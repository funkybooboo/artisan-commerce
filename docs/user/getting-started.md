## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** I can't place an order -- the "Add to Cart" button is disabled
**Solution:** The production queue is at capacity. You can sign up for email notifications when capacity opens up again, or check back in a few days.

**Problem:** I didn't receive a confirmation email
**Solution:** Check your spam folder. If it's not there, contact support with your order number.

**Problem:** The delivery estimate seems too long
**Solution:** Delivery estimates are based on actual production capacity and current queue. Handmade items take time! The estimate is honest and accurate.

**Problem:** I need to change my shipping address after ordering
**Solution:** If it's been less than 12 hours, you can modify your order in your account dashboard. After 12 hours, contact support.

If you need help, contact support at nate.stott@pm.me with:
