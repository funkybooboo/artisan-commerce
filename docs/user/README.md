# User Documentation

Guides for customers using the Artisan Commerce platform.

These docs explain **what you can do** and **how to do it** -- not how it works internally.

## Getting Started

- [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started.md) -- How to create an account and place your first order

## Guides

- **Browsing Projects** -- How to find and filter handmade items
- **Understanding the Queue** -- How production capacity and delivery estimates work
- **Placing Orders** -- Customizing projects and checking out
- **Managing Your Account** -- Saved addresses, favorites, and order history
- **Order Modifications** -- How to change or cancel orders within the allowed windows
- **Digital Patterns** -- Purchasing and downloading patterns

## FAQ

**Q: Why can't I order right now?**
A: The production queue is at capacity. Check back soon or sign up for notifications when capacity opens.

**Q: Can I change my order after placing it?**
A: Yes, within 12 hours for free modifications. After 24 hours, cancellation fees apply.

**Q: How accurate are delivery estimates?**
A: Very accurate. The queue system calculates based on actual production capacity and current workload.

**Q: What payment methods are accepted?**
A: All major credit cards via Stripe. We never store your payment information.

## Writing User Docs

- Write for someone who has never seen the source code
- Use plain language -- no jargon, no implementation details
- Lead with the task, not the feature: "How to order a custom sweater" not "The project system"
- Include examples for every non-obvious step
- Add a Troubleshooting section for anything that commonly goes wrong
